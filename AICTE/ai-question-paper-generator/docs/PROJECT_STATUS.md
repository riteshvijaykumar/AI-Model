streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Direct Script Usage
```python
from src.export.spreadsheet_generator import SpreadsheetGenerator
from src.data_processing.question_parser import QuestionParser

# Load questions
parser = QuestionParser()
questions = parser.parse_file("data/sample_questions.csv")

# Export PDF
generator = SpreadsheetGenerator()
generator.export_to_pdf(
    questions=questions[:10],
    output_path="my_exam.pdf",
    marks_config={
        "2_marks": {"count": 5, "has_choice": False},
