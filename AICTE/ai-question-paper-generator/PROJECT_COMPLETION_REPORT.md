## 🎯 Key Features Demonstration

### Unit-Based Selection Example
```python
# Select from units 1 and 2, total 60 marks
selected_units = ["Unit 1", "Unit 2"]
total_marks = 60

# System automatically distributes:
# - 6 questions of 2 marks = 12 marks
# - 3 questions of 16 marks = 48 marks
# Total: 60 marks
```

### Choice Options Example
```
Question 5: Explain object-oriented programming concepts. (16 marks)
OR
Question 5: Describe inheritance in Python programming. (16 marks)
```
